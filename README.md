# Halls of Madness

## Description
An app created in React to practice fetching from an API and passing functions as props to components.\
Extended by creating a better user interface and by experimenting with adding sound to make the experience as bizarre as possible.

## Still To Do
* Fix bug where a sound occasionally doesn't play on click. I will implement Howler.js/use-sound and experiment with using that for sound.
* Implement loading so sounds load up before starting.
* Turn into a game with scoreboard ala whack-a-mole, where you will have to click when one makes a sound.
* Randomise eye size to some extent.

## Setup
1 - Clone the repository.\
2 - Install dependencies with ```yarn install``` or other package manager.\
3 - Run ```yarn start``` in the project directory from the command line .\
4 - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Built Using
